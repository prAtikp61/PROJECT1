so what exactly is worth knowing think

about how many times you used the

healthcare system how many times you

visited your family doctor or a hospital

ER or had an x-ray or filled a

prescription have you ever wondered how

all that information is maintained and

shared between these points of care or

if it's even shared at all now think

about how this could affect the health

care you receive look at it this way you

visit a local walk-in clinic where the

physician requests a number of tests

unfortunately those test results may not

always be shared with your family doctor

a month later you experienced similar

complications and your family doctor

performs the exact same tests wouldn't

it have been easier and more efficient

if your doctor could have accessed those

original results first in your community

when you visit any point of care

information is collected regarding your

health however because these systems

don't connect information cannot be

easily shared between health care

providers so when a doctor is treating

you there may be pieces of your health

information out there that they don't

know about now consider how important

communication is in an urgent situation

say for example you find yourself in an

ER and you're unable to properly relay

your medical history not knowing for

certain if you're on any medications or

if you have any allergies could hinder

the doctor's assessment and even cause

problems during treatment retrieving

your health info instantly could have

saved time and reduce the possibility of

complications in order to improve

healthcare in Canada we are working to

create and connect a network of

electronic health record systems in your

community province and across the

country which in the future will allow

your health record history to be

securely accessed by every authorized

healthcare provider UC explore this site

and discover how electronic health

records will benefit you so one day no

matter where you are in Canada you'll

know your healthcare provider has access

to your health information because

knowing is better than not knowing
